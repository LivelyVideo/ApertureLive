Privacy Policy

Last Updated: October 8, 2025

This privacy policy applies to the Aperture Live app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Lively Video LLC (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

OVERVIEW

Aperture Live is a mobile broadcasting application that enables you to stream live video to third-party platforms of your choice. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what happens to your video content when you broadcast.

INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

The Application collects and processes the following information:

Device and Usage Information

When you download and use the Application, we may collect:
• Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)
• The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages
• The time spent on the Application
• The operating system you use on your mobile device

The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device. The Application collects your device's approximate geographical location to help the Service Provider analyze user behavior, identify trends, and improve the overall performance and functionality of the Application.

FACE MASK FEATURE

When you enable the face mask feature in Aperture Live, the Application uses your device's front-facing camera to detect and track your face in real-time. This tracking allows the Application to position virtual mask overlays on your face during live broadcasts.

Important Privacy Information:
• All face detection and tracking processing occurs entirely on your device
• No facial recognition data is stored on your device or in our systems
• No facial data is transmitted to Lively Video or any third party
• The mathematical representations (vectors) used for mask positioning are generated in real-time and immediately discarded after use
• You can disable the face mask feature at any time during your broadcast

This technology is similar to camera filters and augmented reality effects used in social media apps. It does not create a biometric profile and cannot be used to identify you.

VIDEO BROADCASTING AND THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS

Aperture Live enables you to broadcast live video to platforms of your choice. When you scan a QR code from a broadcasting platform, you authorize Aperture Live to transmit your video stream to that platform's servers.

What We Transmit:
• Your live video and audio stream to the platform's streaming endpoint (WHIP URL) that you selected by scanning their QR code
• Periodic video frames to the platform's interface displayed within our Application to enable chat, interactions, and other platform features

What You Should Know:
• Video is transmitted directly to the third-party platform you selected
• Lively Video does not control, store, or process your video after transmission
• Each platform has its own privacy policy governing how they handle your content
• We strongly recommend reviewing the privacy policy of any platform before broadcasting to them

Your Control:
• You choose which platforms to broadcast to by scanning their QR codes
• You can stop broadcasting at any time
• Uninstalling Aperture Live stops all video transmission, but does not affect video already transmitted to third-party platforms

For questions about how a specific platform uses your video, please contact that platform directly or review their privacy policy.

DATA WE DO NOT COLLECT

For transparency, we want to be clear about data we DO NOT collect:
• Facial Recognition Data: We do not create, store, or transmit facial recognition databases or biometric identifiers
• Video Storage: We do not store your broadcast video; it is transmitted directly to your chosen platform
• Viewing Analytics: We do not track what you watch or who watches your streams
• Cross-App Tracking: We do not track your activity across other apps or websites for advertising purposes

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:

• Google Play Services: https://policies.google.com/privacy
• Unity: https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy

When you use Aperture Live to broadcast to a third-party platform, that platform becomes a data controller for your video content. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party platforms you choose to broadcast to.

THIRD-PARTY ACCESS AND DATA SHARING

The Service Provider may share aggregated, anonymized usage data with third-party services to help improve the Application and optimize performance. This data does not include your video content or facial tracking information.

The Service Provider may disclose information:
• As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process
• When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request
• With trusted service providers who work on our behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement

We do not sell your personal information to third parties.

CAMERA AND MICROPHONE ACCESS

The Application requires access to your device's camera and microphone to enable video broadcasting. This access is used solely for:
• Capturing video and audio for live broadcasting
• Enabling the face mask feature (optional)

You can revoke camera and microphone permissions at any time through your device's settings, though this will prevent the Application from functioning.

OPT-OUT RIGHTS

You can stop all collection of information by the Application by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

To stop broadcasting to a specific platform, simply stop your broadcast within the Application or disconnect from that platform.

DATA RETENTION POLICY

The Service Provider will retain usage and device information for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter for analytics and improvement purposes.

Important Note: Because we do not store your video content or facial tracking data, there is no video or biometric data to retain or delete. Video is transmitted directly to third-party platforms you select.

If you'd like us to delete usage data that you have provided via the Application, please contact us at support@livelyvideo.tv and we will respond in a reasonable time.

CHILDREN

The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case the Service Provider discovers that a child under 13 has provided personal information, the Service Provider will immediately delete this from their servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact the Service Provider at support@livelyvideo.tv so that we can take the necessary actions.

SECURITY

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.

Your video streams are transmitted using industry-standard encryption protocols. However, please be aware that once your video reaches a third-party platform, the security of that content is governed by that platform's security practices.

INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS

If you use the Application outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located. By using the Application, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have different data protection rules than your country.

Additionally, when you broadcast to third-party platforms, your video may be transmitted to servers in various countries depending on the platform you selected.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

The date of the last update is shown at the top of this policy.

YOUR CONSENT
